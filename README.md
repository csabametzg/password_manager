# Password Manager
Keep your passwords in your own Python Program

Imported Python libraries: tkinter, random, pyperclip, json  

The great problem is, how can we remember of all own passwords? It is a great challenge, right? Today, we have to register on most of platforms, websites to log in for contents or we need to create an account for the membership. The safe recommendation, that we have to use unique passwords on all websites, and it should be min. 8-12 characters long and contains big-small alphabets, numbers and unique characters too.

Thats why is very useful to save our passwords somewhere where we can search back.

The Password Manager Python Program is a way, that we our pass don't forget anymore. After hit run, we can type:

1. Neme of te website
2. E-mail or Username
3. Password

In the case of 1-2 step we need to fill in the forms. 3rd step: next to the password form we have a "Generate Password" button. Just click it, and you will get a 16 characters long safety password with letters - inkl. small-big alphabets, symbols and numbers.

Click to "Add" button and it's Done.

How you can find your saved password?

Just type the name of Website, for example: Amazon (1. step) and click to "Search" button next to Website form. It will come a Popup, where is your E-mail/Username with your password displayed. You need just click there, and your password will copy to clipboard automaticly. After that you can easily paste (CTRL + V) to the field of password. (Where you want to use it.)

* We use in this program a JSON dictionary format to save our data (data.json). We can also open it and check.
